Path generation updates
=======================

The path generator can now produce routes with more variety:

* Facility branches may connect to non-adjacent enemy encounters, allowing the player to skip over an enemy and reach a later fight sooner.
* Some facility branches can now lead to an optional detour battle before continuing, creating runs with an extra combat encounter.
* Detour encounters reuse the next scheduled enemy configuration and reward players with gold that averages the surrounding encounters.
* The path layout automatically adds extra spacing when a detour is inserted so that nodes do not overlap in the UI.
* Skip and detour behaviour is controlled by `skipConnectionChance` and `detourConnectionChance` constructor options (both default to 0.35) so maps can tune how often the new connections appear.

These changes mean a map run can involve as few as two or as many as four regular battles before the boss, depending on the route the player selects.
